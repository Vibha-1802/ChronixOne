## 📱 Mobile Prototype

### 🟣 1. Edge Case Year Transition

Tests the app’s ability to correctly compute next dates for years that are edge cases for year(31/12/1903 -> 01/01/1904).

### 🟣 2. Edge Case Month Transition

Validates the transition from end-of-month to next month (e.g., 31/03 → 01/04).

### 🟣 4. Century Year (Not Leap Year)

Tests years divisible by 100 but not by 400 — e.g., 1900.

App displays:

1900 is a Century but not a Leap Year

### 🟣 5. Leap Year + Century Year

Tests years divisible by 400 such as 2000.

App displays:

2000 is both a Leap Year and a Century

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### Leap Year Algorithm

If year % 400 == 0 → leap year + century year

Else if year % 100 == 0 → century year

Else if year % 4 == 0 → leap year

Else → not leap year

### Next Date Algorithm

day = day + 1

If day > maxDaysOfMonth → day = 1, month++

If month > 12 → month = 1, year++

### Year Type Algorithm

Determines if the year is:

Leap Year

Century Year

Both

Neither
